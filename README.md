## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of Iris flowers: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. This project fulfills the following objectives:
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset.
2. Perform basic statistical analysis, including mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. Create visualizations to explore relationships in the data.
4. Provide observations and insights based on the analysis and visualizations.

This project is submitted as part of an assignment and will be reviewed by the instructor.

## Assignment Tasks

The project is structured to meet the following tasks:

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Save the Iris dataset to a CSV file.
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- Explore the structure of the dataset by checking data types and missing values.
- Clean the dataset by confirming there are no missing values.

### **Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
- Compute basic statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
- Perform grouping by species and compute the mean of numerical columns for each group.
- Identify patterns or interesting findings from the analysis.

### **Task 3: Data Visualization**
- Create at least four visualizations:
  1. Line chart showing petal length trends by species.
  2. Bar chart showing average petal width by species.
  3. Histogram showing the distribution of sepal length.
  4. Scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and petal length.
- Customize plots with titles, axis labels, and legends.
- Use `seaborn` for additional styling and visualizations (e.g., pairplot).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations and styling.
- **Scikit-learn**: For accessing the Iris dataset.

   python3 iris_analysis_and_visualization.py
   ```

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   If you prefer an interactive environment, open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook iris_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb
   ```

---

## Usage

- **Python Script**: Run the `iris_analysis_and_visualization.py` script to execute all tasks sequentially.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Use the `iris_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb` notebook for an interactive experience with explanations and outputs.

## Visualizations

The project generates the following visualizations:
1. **Line Chart**: Petal length trends by species.
2. **Bar Chart**: Average petal width by species.
3. **Histogram**: Distribution of sepal length.
4. **Scatter Plot**: Sepal length vs. petal length.
5. **Pairplot**: Pairwise relationships among features.

---

## Observations

Key insights from the analysis:
1. **Setosa** species has the smallest petal and sepal dimensions.
2. **Virginica** species has the largest petal dimensions.
3. There is a strong positive correlation between petal length and sepal length.
4. The pairplot shows clear separations among species in petal-related dimensions.
