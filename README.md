# Iris Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This project is an assignment by **William Oneka** for analyzing and visualizing the Iris dataset using Python. The project demonstrates data loading, exploration, statistical analysis, and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights in the dataset. It is designed to meet the requirements outlined by the instructor.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of Iris flowers: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. This project fulfills the following objectives:
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset.
2. Perform basic statistical analysis, including mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. Create visualizations to explore relationships in the data.
4. Provide observations and insights based on the analysis and visualizations.

This project is submitted as part of an assignment and will be reviewed by the instructor.

## Assignment Tasks

The project is structured to meet the following tasks:

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Save the Iris dataset to a CSV file.
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- Explore the structure of the dataset by checking data types and missing values.
- Clean the dataset by confirming there are no missing values.

### **Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
- Compute basic statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
- Perform grouping by species and compute the mean of numerical columns for each group.
- Identify patterns or interesting findings from the analysis.

### **Task 3: Data Visualization**
- Create at least four visualizations:
  1. Line chart showing petal length trends by species.
  2. Bar chart showing average petal width by species.
  3. Histogram showing the distribution of sepal length.
  4. Scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and petal length.
- Customize plots with titles, axis labels, and legends.
- Use `seaborn` for additional styling and visualizations (e.g., pairplot).
